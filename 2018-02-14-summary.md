## Invalid Alloc Messages

### Comments

- Alloc Requests from the bridge are arriving with an invalid timestamp at the farmer, no chance to answer them correctly. ( https://github.com/Storj/complex/issues/76 )
- Performance Issues due to the Signing with the javascript lib instead of the faster lib used in Core already

## Bridge Downtime

### Comments

- Likely MongoDB Performance Issues
- no further details known

## Audits

### Comments

- Wont be activated with the current network design
- Needs also revisit of the current implementation
- Users are able to delete all shards after shard upload to their node ( https://github.com/Storj/core/issues/760 )

## Download Failures

### Comments

- 9 out of 10 Download result in a failure. Even directly after uploading them to the network, the bridge has no nodes to download the shard from
- Independent of the shard size
- Possibility of coincidence with the bridge issues
