## MaxShardSize & SpaceAvailable

### Comments
- Farmer permant switch to noSpaceLeft when Shard Size is too big (https://github.com/Storj/core/issues/752)
- Known Workaround is the setting MaxShardSize to a correct value, this only solves the sideeffect, issue still open
- Pull requests for Bridge and Farmer need further review (https://github.com/Storj/bridge/pull/547, https://github.com/Storj/core/pull/753
- spaceAvailable Flag isnt updated on the API / bridge (https://github.com/Storj/core/issues/738)
- interval detecting the spaceAvailable is not running (deactivated)

## Small Files

### Comments
- 1 Byte files cant be uploaded to the network (eg. small metadata)
- Metadata consumses about 15kB right now
- Padding as described in the whitepaper might be a suitable solution, 512kB could be a good minimum shard size

## PoW Challenges & Creation of new Nodes

### Comments
- New Nodes have problems when registering at the bridge (https://github.com/Storj/bridge/issues/527 and https://github.com/Storj/bridge/issues/524
- PoW isnt working as expected, Farmer run into these code lines (https://github.com/Storj/core/blob/9691c6a17991a0487e1069a1000db5035b1c57ba/lib/network/farmer.js#L401)
- possible solution might be to use PoW with kademila (https://github.com/kadtools/kad-hashcash)

## Tunnel Connections

### Comments
- Tunnel Connections are still frequently used by Farmers
- with SIP9 the tunnel downtime can lead to loss of contracts/payment
- marking the Connection sign as RED instead of ORANGE would show a better indication for Farmer
- Making the uPnP and TCP Guides more easier to go through may help also
