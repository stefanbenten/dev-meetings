- Gossip Protocol

## Detailed meeting logs

## KAD Communication

### Comments
- Communication with the RenterIDs is suboptimal 
- Complex Pull Request might reduce the number of ping messages and keep the contact list healthy ( https://github.com/Storj/complex/pull/91 )
- Possibility to reduce load on farmer and bridge side (less message handling needed)

## Contract Renewal & SIP09

### Comments
- Contract Renewal has been merged, final tests are done on staging
- no decision if Contract Renewal gets deployed together with SIP09
- Issues with immediate deletions of shards and the timeoutrate reset needs to be fixed before SIP09 goes live

## Decentralized Bridge and new Network Architecture

### Comments
- Gossip protocol should build the base for the new architecture
- Move away from KAD (not needed with the gossip protocol) and KFS (resource hungry)
- possible Solutions for Storage Layer ( https://github.com/aleitner/libfilestore , https://github.com/aleitner/libmapstore )
- Better Resource Handling for StorjShare is a key design factor
- Multicast will be difficult to implement and maintain stable over the WWW, gets blocked by many ISPs (Design here: https://github.com/braydonf/libstorjshare )
- Current Plan was to make a upload streaming to improve mirror creation reliability (commit Upload after sucessfull mirror creation)
- Possible Solution is to have a Contract Revoke when farmer doesnt create mirrors in a specific timeframe
- Auditing every shard will lead to scaling issues, Audit per Farmer might be a better approach
- Focus should be aiming the API as well (not only libstorj, cause 2/3 developers use the API directly)
- Make Upload/Download Mechanism easier, possible via curl or http (without frames, pointers and a like)
- Local "Bridge" on the client side to handle request locally (Erasure Encoding, Encryption)
- Programming Language still node defined for the new architecture

## Gossip Protocol

### Comments
- Chosen because it can be implementing several things ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gossip_protocol , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacies_of_distributed_computing )
- No good way to differ between good and bad farmers, also relay messages can still be dropped
- good starting point to check out the gossip protocol: https://flopezluis.github.io/gossip-simulator/
- Readup for getting structure into a network ( https://community.storj.io/file-upload/cmSqod3c5Y4d2zCcn/oehlmann2014machinelearningPeerToPeerBandwidthManagement.pdf , https://gnunet.org/ats-subsystem )
