## Bridge Update & Performance Issues

### Comments
- Pull request still not deployed ( https://github.com/Storj/bridge/pull/554 and https://github.com/Storj/bridge/pull/547 )
- Core Update also not done yet ( https://github.com/Storj/core/pull/755 )
- Payout Script might slow down Bridge Responsiveness and lead to Timeouts / high Responsetime on Farmer Side
- 75% Failure Rate during uploads (Error 500) and inability to retreive a fresh uploaded file 


## Public Testnetwork

### Comments
- No confirmation if testnetwork is accepted from Storj Labs ( to deploy the intended Changes on it first)
- Able to test features with a limited number of nodes to track issues down more effective
- External influences are better applicable and noticeable than on the internal staging network

## Contract Renewal & SIP09

### Comments
- Contract Renewal Design is working, but the script is very slow
- Code needs review for backwards compatibility
- Script needs to run at least 2 times a day
- Shorten the Contract Length (90 to 30 days) will help to mitigate the payment problem, but does not solve the root issue
