## Contract Renewals

### Comments
- Should come also as a cronjob like SIP9

## Mirror Creation

### Comments
- Researches in UDP Multicasting for Creation
- should be more reliable with SIP9

## IPv6

### Comments
- IPv6 is totally broken, Farmers get Reputation Drops, if Renter has no IPv6
- Bridge doesnt has an IPv6 Entry (AAAA Record) -> No way for IPv6 only Users
- Would solve the PIA VPN needs for CGN Users (former DS-Lite)
- Checks are needed if libraries works as intended

## Timeoutrate

### Comments
- Not solved yet, no updates

## Bridge Issues

### Comments
- Slow Response of API and Renter GUI.
- Probably increasing Responsetime for Farmers too (https://community.storj.io/channel/dev?msg=LnnaksqGGyYDGzqBD)
- There are some monogoDB Errors right now, Alexander is investigating atm
