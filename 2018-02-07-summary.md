## Open Issues (Bridge)

### Comments
- Farmer sends unpaid mirror traffic twice ( https://github.com/Storj/bridge/issues/564 and https://github.com/Storj/bridge/issues/348 )
- Issue that 1 farmer needs to create all mirrors has been fixed ( https://github.com/Storj/bridge/issues/510#issuecomment-363674444 )
- The Reports might cause double triggering of creation/sending the mirror data
- 

## Review of the current Network Architecture

### Comments

List of Pros and Cons of the current network architecture:

#### Pro:
- All message are signed
- direct Shard Upload to the farmer
- Mirror Creation between the farmer
- Full Bandwidth available, no proxy bottleneck
- Speed for File Transfers
- Payout is late but low risk for farmers
- Daemon is restarting the node itself in case of a crash
- Maintenance / Development with the GUI on top of the Daemon is easy
- Shards are random and geographically distributed
- Reed Solomon can recover files, even in case of a big number of bad farmer
- Its easy to get started and upload/download a file
- Replication saved the work necessary with shard recovery
- Recovery Informations are done on the Renter Side
- Good testing around data models
- Lots of great unit testing
- I can get information about other mirrors but cant get the encryption key

#### Cons:
- RAM Usage is to high ( might be a NodeJS Issue)
- KFS Storage Layer
- Needed Public Port ( many configuration issues on farmer side)
- no easy HTTP/ JSON Access for Uploads/Downloads
- too many open files
- too many open TCP connections
- no public files
- Slow Response Time from a bridge ( up to 60 seconds for a single request answer )
- Unpredictable Payout / fixed rate is missing
- SPOF ( Single Point of Failure ) - Bridge is the core and fragilest component of the network
- Support for small files ( many of them ) isnt great
- Reed Solomon is not included in the renter pricing right now
- Not great support for streaming or large files
- Reed Solomon is bad for streaming
- No good way to detect lost shards and letting the network know about it
- Data Structure is very complicated, bad for fast answers
- Farmers can be stalked via the Bridge API without any auth
- Payout List is public and can lead to interesting information
