## SIP9 Deployment

### Comments
- Needs further review/testing before being deployed
- Open issues needs to be solved first before losing the complete network as a result (eg. https://github.com/Storj/bridge/pull/521#pullrequestreview-79037609)
- Outstanding issues with farmer payouts and with nodeid reference that need to be fixed

## SIP9 Downtime

### Comments
- More than 11 hours downtime in 72 hours will mark storage events as ended for the farmer
- This is due to the 99.99% availability calculation (https://github.com/Storj/bridge/pull/521/commits/8accba1ac5c488ed114087f6f139f54e604cf3f9)

## SIP9 Payments

### Comments
- Method to calculate farmer payouts wasn't clear
- Both payout calculations can be made using SIP9 data ([see test queries](https://gist.github.com/braydonf/2758ad07be5a6c19a5b37c69fe51dd8b#file-sip9-queries-js-L65)) and previous data
- Might cause payout issues with farmers if data is uploaded and immediately deleted by users
  - The data will stay around for 90 days on the farmer side, except the payout would only consider the short duration from the user side, leading to stale unpaid data
  - Shortening contract length to 1 month and renewing each month is a possible solution
  - Sending RENEW message to shorten the duration is another option
  - Having a minimum payout of the contract duration even if the data is deleted is another option

## Performance Issues / Small Files

### Comments
- Bridge / API is really slow, especially with small file sizes
- Record is 8 minutes for a single download filepointer
- MongoDB might be the limiting factor and bottleneck
- Smaller files have the potential to generate larger amounts of meta data that describes the location of the data than there is data and would be better to be inlined instead
- Including the data in the metadata itself brings to attention the need to replicate and decentralize the metadata in the same way that data is currently replicated to farmers

## IPv6

### Comments
- No updates yet
- Kubernetes dont have IPv6 Support
