## SIP9 Deployment

### Comments
- Needs further review/testing before being deployed
- Open issues needs to be solved first before losing the complete network as a result (eg. https://github.com/Storj/bridge/pull/521#pullrequestreview-79037609)
## SIP9 Downtime

### Comments
- more than 11 Hours downtime in 72 Hours will delete all contracts of the farmer
- This is due to the 99,99% Availability Calculation ( https://github.com/Storj/bridge/pull/521/commits/8accba1ac5c488ed114087f6f139f54e604cf3f9 )

## SIP9 Payments

### Comments
- payment way isnt clear
- might destroy the network after the first payout
- Storing Files longer on Farmer side after deletion from renter side is not defined if paid or unpaid

## Performance Issues / Small Files

### Comments
- Bridge / API really slow, especially with small file sizes
- Record is 8 minutes for a single download filepointer
- MongoDB might be the limiting factor
