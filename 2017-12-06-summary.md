## Detailed meeting logs

- https://community.storj.io/channel/dev?msg=qhi9uXnMm2pqyy5DC

## Sync ability

### Comments
- Libstorj is already multithreaded (for better throughput)
- Open issue with small packets still existing (https://github.com/Storj/bridge/issues/528)
- Upload Throughput is limited by the bridge at the moment

## Shard Reaper

### Comments
- Shard Reaper still needed to delete old contracts/shards
- possibility to add a manual start/disabling command like storjshare reaper now/disable
- Will be quicker with better indexing and other file system

## IPv6 Tests

### Comments
- Bridge has no AAAA Pointer (IPv6 Entry) for api.storj.io
- Google Kubernetes doesnt support public IPv6
- Messages get send, but no error -> 100% Timeout

## TimeoutRate Bug

### Comments
- Still existing, but not that important if Reputation is used
- No automatic reset
- to reset a new timeout has to be forced/made
- Timeoutrate Update before Contract Deletion needs review (ref. @littleskunk)

## Mirror Creation/Distribution

### Comments
- Still uses the Timeoutrate to select Farmers (https://github.com/Storj/bridge/issues/526)
- Farmer with a Timeoutrate > 0 will never get a mirrored shard
- Action: Use Reputation instead of Timeoutrate

## SIP9 Offline Timeframe

### Comments
- 1 hour is to short for the allows offline quota
- Requested Feature: Quota of X hours within Y days
- Give users no penalty for short maintenance to maintain their stability (3-6 hrs)
- Might conflict with the PING Monitor intverval
- No way to give a bridge a hint for being offline

## Daemon Restarts

### Comments
- Daemon stops after restarting 30 times, Nodes with many forced errors will stay down
- Fault are unstable nodes itself (misconfiguration) -> no further action needed

## Maximum Shard Size

### Comments
- There were uploads during november with Shard Size beyond 32GB, up to 2TB
- Forced most nodes to switch to nospaceleft = true (https://github.com/Storj/core/issue/752)
- Bridge doesnt get informed of spaceAvailable = false 
- Fix is ready to be merged (https://github.com/Storj/core/pull/753)

## NodeJS 8

### Comments
- NodeJS 8 Support is ready to be merged
