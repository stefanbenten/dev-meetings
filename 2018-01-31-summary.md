## Open Issues (Bridge)

### Comments
- Issue #560 has Integration Test failures. Contract Renewal is not building as expected 
- ALLOC message to long time offline farmer (Issue #557) will decrease the even distribution of shards and create a lot of unneeded messages
- Solution might be to mark them as offline if they meet certain criteria using SpaceAvailable = false
- When the farmer comes back online the variable will get set back to true automatically

## Complex Timeout Issue

### Comments
- Bridge claims to send a message to the farmer which never arrives on the farmer side
- Leads to timeouts even if the farmer responds to all messages he really gets
- possibility of a load issue on the bridge, which causes dropped outgoing messages
- During high load there is a rate of 10 from 25 requests timed out - farmer only got 15 requests
- Average is likely lower than this 40% mark (10/25)
- Likelyhood of refactoring this code is quite high

## Core Release
- Fix of shard size issue gets resolved with it
- Pull Requests #753, #751 and #755 awaiting last review
