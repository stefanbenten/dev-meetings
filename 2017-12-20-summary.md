## SIP9 Review and Issues

### Comments
- Farmer Behaviour after Downtime is getting not monitored. Results in offline shards without ability to create new mirrors
- Monitor wont try to ping the Farmer  and Alloc doesnt count as timeout
- Reconsider the LastSeen Sorting

## Whitepaper

### Comments
- Whitepaper Intro is done
- Proof of Retrieveability and Audits needs review
- Same for Issue with Quasar, Switching to use Reputation (SIP6)
- NAT Traversal is still open
- Erasure Encoding is a must have
- Proxy Re-Encryption needs further investigation

## Small Files

### Comments
- Metadata takes more space than file itself
- Reconsider the LastSeen sorting for download pointer
- A possible attack vector. Upload millions of 1Byte files. Farmer don't get the payment they are looking for and the network is full of unpaid meta data.
- How do we pay if we don't have any contract information, when storing the small files without them?
- First whitepaper described using the blockchain for storing the contracts and metadata
- Higher fees would be a possible way to solve this discrepancy
